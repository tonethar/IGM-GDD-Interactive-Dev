### Comments on BS-GDD Program Goals

1. Do 119 & 219 really involve "game design & gameplay concepts"?
2. Does 119 really involve "programming, math, physics and game design"?
3. Do 119 & 219 really involve "game design and technology concepts in the practice of game creation"?
4. No comments
5. In 110, are static web pages what we think of as "media-centric experiences"? Technically they are, but 202, 230 and 330 seem more represenntative of this.
6. No comments
7. How are we *specifically* meeting the goal of "Identify critical legal and ethical challenges" in the listed courses?
8. The course outcomes for 202 & 230 do not list

110 | This course provides an overview of media in historical, current and future contexts. Incorporating lectures and discussion with hands on work involving written and interactive media assets, students examine the role of written and visual media from theoretical as well as practical perspectives.  The course also provides an introduction to interactive media development techniques, including digital media components and delivery environments.  Students will be required to write formal analysis and critique papers along with digital modes of writing including collaborative editing and effective presentation design.  | None | We have been running a NMID cohorted section of 110 for 2 years now. Have any changes been made to
